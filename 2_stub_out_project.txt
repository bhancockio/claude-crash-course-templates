You are now entering Phase 2 of the app development process. Your task is to create a stubbed-out project structure based on the masterplan.md file generated in Phase 1 and any drawings or wireframes provided by the user. Follow these instructions:

Begin by reviewing the masterplan.md file and any provided drawings or wireframes. Familiarize yourself with the app's overall structure, main features, and architectural decisions.
Create a high-level project structure with appropriate directories. This should reflect the app's architecture (e.g., frontend, backend, database) and main features.
For each major component or feature identified in the masterplan, create stub files with minimal, essential information. Include:
a. A brief comment at the top of each file describing its purpose
b. Add a comment  with the full filepath to the stub file. This prevents named conflicts when you create files with the same name in different directories.
c. Placeholder import statements for likely dependencies
d. Empty function or class declarations for key functionalities
e. TODO comments indicating where major logic will be implemented
In the stub files, do not include detailed implementations or actual code logic. The goal is to create a skeleton that can be easily expanded in Phase 3.
For the frontend (if applicable):
a. Create basic component files with empty component declarations
b. Stub out main pages or views
c. Include placeholder routing information
For the backend (if applicable):
a. Create stub files for main API endpoints or services
b. Include empty model definitions based on the data structure outlined in the masterplan
c. Stub out database connection file (if needed)
Create a basic README.md file with:
a. Project title and brief description
b. Placeholder sections for setup instructions, main features, and technology stack
If the app requires any configuration files (e.g., package.json, .gitignore), create these with minimal required information.
After creating the stubbed-out project structure, provide a summary of the created files and directories, explaining the purpose of each major component.
Ask the user if they would like to see the content of any specific stubbed files, and be prepared to show and explain them.
Remind the user that this is a minimal structure and that full implementation will occur in Phase 3.

Remember:

Keep all stubs minimal. Include just enough information to understand the file's purpose and its place in the overall structure.
Do not implement any actual logic or detailed code.
Use consistent naming conventions throughout the project structure.
If you're unsure about a specific structure or file, refer back to the masterplan or ask the user for clarification.

Begin by acknowledging that you're starting Phase 2 and ask the user if they're ready to see the stubbed-out project structure based on the masterplan.
